## Overview

Linux powers everything from smartphones and IoT nodes to hyperscale clusters and the world’s fastest supercomputers. The mainline kernel evolves on a transparent cadence while preserving multi-decade ABI stability.

- **Primary branches:** `master` (development), `linux-6.y` (stable), `linux-next` (integration).
- **Release cadence:** Major releases every 8–10 weeks; stable updates weekly.
- **Governance:** Review-driven patch series coordinated by subsystem maintainers via mailing lists.

## Kernel Architecture

| Layer | Responsibilities | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User space | Applications, shells, libraries | glibc, systemd, container runtimes |
| System call interface | Stable ABI boundary | VDSO, seccomp, compatibility shims |
| Kernel core | Scheduler, memory management, VFS | CFS, NUMA balancing, tmpfs |
| Subsystems & drivers | Filesystems, networking, security, arch ports | BPF, io_uring, SELinux, arm64, riscv |

```

## Building from Source

```bash
# Install tooling (Debian/Ubuntu example)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev dwarves bc

# Clone the canonical tree
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux

# Configure
make menuconfig  # or oldconfig/xconfig/nconfig

# Build using every available core
make -j"$(nproc)"

# Install modules + kernel
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
```

> 💡 Tip: stash your `.config` in version control or use `git worktree` to juggle multiple builds.

## Contributor Workflow

1. **Sync:** `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master`.
2. **Develop:** work in topic branches; keep patches atomic and logically ordered.
3. **Self-review:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict path/to/patch.patch
   make -j"$(nproc)" W=1
   make clang-analyzer
   ```
4. **Submit:** send patches via `git send-email` to maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS`.
5. **Follow up:** track review threads on lore.kernel.org and iterate with v2/v3 revisions as required.

## Directory Cheat Sheet

| Path | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| `arch/` | Architecture ports (x86, arm64, riscv, …) |
| `drivers/` | Device drivers grouped by subsystem |
| `include/` | Kernel + UAPI headers (`uapi/` ⇒ user space ABI) |
| `kernel/` | Scheduler, locking, timekeeping, cgroups |
| `tools/` | `perf`, `bpftool`, `spi-tools`, testing harnesses |
| `Documentation/` | Canonical manuals, style guides, workflows |

## Testing Matrix

- **KernelCI:** automated boot and smoke tests across diverse hardware.
- **syzbot (syzkaller):** continuous syscall fuzzing with automated bug reports.
- **kselftest:** in-tree validation suite (`make kselftest`).
- **LTP:** Linux Test Project focusing on ABI and syscall conformance.

## Philosophy

> “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” — Linus Torvalds

---

Linux is the collective expression of open collaboration operating at planetary scale. Whether you write drivers, tune schedulers, or study the evolving ABI, welcome to the kernel community.
